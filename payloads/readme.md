# Payloads

This folder contains different payloads for Mirage.
On Mirage, a payload is an M-mode program that is deprivileged by Mirage through trap-and-emulate.

When running Mirage using `just run` the `default` payload is used.
Other payloads are used by integration tests when running `just test`.
