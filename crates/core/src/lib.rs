//! Miralis core definition
//!
//! This crate purpose is to hold core types and constants definitions for user by other crates.
//! In particular, this crate does not hold any code, this is important as not all code is
//! portable, but some of the definitions here can be used in lots of different contexts (such as
//! in Miralis itself, from firmware or external tooling).
